# WinHacks Hackathon Project: Energy Comsumption Breakdown ⚡
In a world where we consume a lot of energy it is important to know where it comes from.

Our web app takes address search and returns the power consumption breakdown of what kind of energy source
your power comes from. 

Live Webpage: https://syndicategit.github.io/CheckYourSource/ 

# Technologies Used
1. React
2. Chart.js for displaying pi chart representation of data
3. Geocodify api for geocoding address search into longitude latitude
4. Electricity Map api for fetching energy source data based on longitude latitude query.

# What we learned:
1. We cannot hide API keys on static websites
2. How to pull data from a form and query it from an API
3. A bit of React
4. Color schemes and fonts are important
5. Geocoding with an api to fetch longitude latitude based on searching incomplete addresses
6. Displaying data as a pi chart using Chart.js React
7. Using HTML tables
